## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "No results found" for suppliers

**Reasons:**

- Search terms might be too specific

**Solutions:**
1. Broaden your material descriptions
2. Check neighboring states/regions
3. Use alternative material names
4. Manually search: Google, IndiaMART, TradeKey

---

### ❌ "AI is taking too long" (>2 minutes)

**Why:**
- System searching web for suppliers

**What to do:**
1. ✅ Wait up to 3 minutes
2. ✅ Don't refresh the page
3. ✅ Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. ✅ If stuck, refresh and try again

---

### ❌ "Backend connection error"

**Reasons:**
- Backend server not running (Terminal 2)
- API port 8000 is in use

**Solutions:**

# Check if backend is running
# Terminal 2 should show: "Application startup complete"

# If port 8000 is in use:
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Restart backend:
uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### ❌ "Ollama not available" error

**Reasons:**
- Ollama server not running (Terminal 1)
